## System overview
MERCED hosts 41 CPU compute nodes and 25 high memory nodes. Please be aware that
the nodes among MERCED cluster are multigenerational, meaning that the CPU
processors from different nodes are having different features, the table shows below
listed detailed node information. Users may experience relative big
performance variations when running the same jobs on different nodes.

The table below listed all MERCED cluster CPU compute nodes features, and their
processors generations.

| Nodes        | feature                                                    | RAM   | Total cores per nodes | InfiniBand (IB) |

_Note: MERCED is no longer supporting Jupyterhub._


## Merced Queue Information:
| Public Queues(Available to all users)| Max Wall Time | Default Time | Max Nodes per Job | Max # of jobs that can be submitted | 
| -------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| bigmem | 5 days | 1 hr | 2 nodes | 6 | 
| test^ | 1 hour | 5 min. | 2 nodes | 1 |
| *compute | 5 days | 1 hr | 2 nodes | 6 | 
| NOTE: `#SBATCH -M merced ` must always be used to submit a job to MERCED cluster|
| ^ `test` queue has access to all node types use constraints to test on specific types.  e.g. `#SBATCH --constraint=ib `|
| * `compute` queue is the default queue for all jobs submitted  |


## Requesting an account
Request an account via the UC Merced IT website Research Computing
[website](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=643ea9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcba3&form_id=280d8bb04f72f6006137d0af0310c7b0).
Before apply an account, please read the following information
carefully. Note that MERCED is a recharge model, which means PI must provide COA information in the ticket before they can use MERCED. 

>What do I need to get this service?

An active PI or student __with a PI advisor__ can submit this
request by completing this [request
form](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=643ea9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcba3&form_id=280d8bb04f72f6006137d0af0310c7b0).

Each PI account has at least one user group and one queue project
associate with it, which may be used by all group members. PIâ€™s must notify the system administration staff when students, postdoctorals, and other group members depart the University and should no longer have access to MERCED. All data stored in a user accounts will be accessible at all times by the associated PI.
>What is included?

OIT will verify the eligibility and create the appropriate account for
either a PI Group or a user. Please review the following information
prior to the consultation to help determine the best solution for your
needs:
* Faculty PIs __must__ complete and __sign__ an Export Control Attestation
[form](https://ucmerced.box.com/s/e6pmv4cv59tz76aat5re1kzvg23c0s09)
prior to being given access to managed systems
* Users can install any licensed software packages in their __home__
  directories on MERCED, and where appropriate for other systems. If
  you need assistance, submit a [Research Software Installation Request](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbde&form_id=0cb3dca04f7d4300b52ba1618110c7ff)(Servers and Clusters), including on which system to install the software
* The MERCED cluster uses a queuing system for job submission.
  Priorities of jobs are assigned on a dynamic basis. Not all jobs
  submitted will begin immediately.

## How to cite
All MERCED users must agree to acknowledge the MERCED Cluster and the
supporting NSF grant (ACI-1429783) in talks, posters, manuscripts, and
other forms of dissemination relying on results obtained from time on
MERCED. An example acknowledgement section is:
```text
