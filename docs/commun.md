**Subject: CIRT Recharge Center Hiatus - Waiving Recharge Costs**

Dear MERCED cluster PIs -

 

The Cyber Infrastructure and Research Technologies (CIRT) team is aware that our recent move to a recharge model has been a pain point for some research groups, and we are working with the Provost’s office to obtain bridge funding to offset CIRT recharge costs for faculty.

 

Until this bridge funding is secured, OIT-CIRT is in an immediate recharge hiatus, retroactive to January 1, 2022. We will continue to waive all costs for faculty using CIRT recharge services, including costs for using MERCED cluster core-hours, until further notice.

 

This is a fluid situation, but we anticipate that costs will be waived through at least April 2022, and possibly beyond. Once details have been finalized, we will reach out again to inform you, and we will also provide all users with at least one month’s notice before recharges begin again.

 

Notes:

 

During the recharge hiatus, CIRT will continue to monitor and record usage on the MERCED cluster toward our goal of operating as a recharge center. Principal investigators will continue to receive monthly reports to track their group’s core-hour usage.
 

Research groups needing MERCED cluster access will continue to be required to ensure their user and COA information provided [here](https://login.microsoftonline.com/f4dfe9a3-ca78-4998-b7a7-e6d0692eace6/oauth2/authorize?client_id=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&response_mode=form_post&protectedtoken=true&response_type=code%20id_token&resource=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&scope=openid&nonce=74817F0D7870D6EF7E4073B97706ED2FE1030003B869546F-842C588301A4BBE35FE1718729B638B64ED1A2007B1773EA306E78C1D1272E10&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmerced-my.sharepoint.com%2F_forms%2Fdefault.aspx&state=OD0w&claims=%7B%22id_token%22%3A%7B%22xms_cc%22%3A%7B%22values%22%3A%5B%22CP1%22%5D%7D%7D%7D&wsucxt=1&cobrandid=11bd8083-87e0-41b5-bb78-0bc43c8a8e8a&client-request-id=1b3d25a0-800a-1000-9a79-2d73fe130045) (sign-in required) is up-to-date.
 

All MERCED cluster communications and updates will be posted on the CIRT documentation website here.
 

Once again, I am happy to discuss any questions you might have – you can schedule a one-on-one consultation with me [here](https://arrangr.com/sarvani/rechargemeeting).

**Subject: MERCED cluster core-hour usage and cost report**

Dear MERCED cluster PIs –


What is new?
 

Here is the 1st MERCED cluster core-hour usage and cost report for January 01/01/22 – 01/15/22.
 

This report contains

PI group core-hour usage
Individual user core-hour usage
Core-hour usage costs
 

From 01/01/22 – 01/15/22.
 

This usage report does not factor baseline free monthly allocation of 100 core-hours per user.
 

How do I limit my group from using any more core-hours on MERCED?
 

You can request access limits for your group [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) or by responding to this email.
 

Remember, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access to these systems. Schedule a consultation [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=643ea9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcba3&form_id=280d8bb04f72f6006137d0af0310c7b0).
 

What is happening?

 

As previously announced, with the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, CIRT transitioned MERCED cluster to a recharge service effective January 1, 2022.

 

Users will receive a monthly baseline allocation of 100 core-hours and Faculty PIs will be responsible for covering costs that exceed this baseline allocation.
