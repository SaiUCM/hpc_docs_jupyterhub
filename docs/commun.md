## 1/1/22-1/15/22
Dear MERCED cluster PIs –


What is new?
 

Here is the 1st MERCED cluster core-hour usage and cost report for January 01/01/22 – 01/15/22.
 

This report contains

PI group core-hour usage
Individual user core-hour usage
Core-hour usage costs
 

From 01/01/22 – 01/15/22.
 

This usage report does not factor baseline free monthly allocation of 100 core-hours per user.
 

How do I limit my group from using any more core-hours on MERCED?
 

You can request access limits for your group [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) or by responding to this email.
 

Remember, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access to these systems. Schedule a consultation [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=643ea9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcba3&form_id=280d8bb04f72f6006137d0af0310c7b0).
 

What is happening?

 

As previously announced, with the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, CIRT transitioned MERCED cluster to a recharge service effective January 1, 2022.

 

Users will receive a monthly baseline allocation of 100 core-hours and Faculty PIs will be responsible for covering costs that exceed this baseline allocation.
