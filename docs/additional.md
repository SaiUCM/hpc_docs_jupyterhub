## Additional Computational Resources <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
Some researchers may have needs that exceed our campus computing capabilities. They may need more machines to complete a task quickly or they may need more specialized types of computing nodes (e.g. GPU nodes). We have access to both the [San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC)](https://www.sdsc.edu/) and the national-level computing resources known as [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/). SDSC and XSEDE offer significant amounts of compute time to researchers interested in trying HPC at large-scales. 

Information about additional resources through XSEDE and HPC@UC Program can be found [here](hpc_uc.md). 

Please note that XSEDE ends on August 31,2022 and will be transitioning to ACCESS. For more information, please read the XSEDE to ACCESS [website](https://www.xsede.org/advancetoaccess).
