 ### [The unix shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
> The lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the shell. If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing), you’re ready for this lesson.

!> If you’re already comfortable manipulating files and directories, searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/)
### [Version control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
> Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

!> In this lesson Git is used from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, but isn’t mandatory.

### [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
> The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.

### [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
> This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example. This lesson references JupyterLab but can be taught using alternative Python 3 interpreters as well (e.g., repl.it, Anaconda).

### [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
> The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.


!> Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.
