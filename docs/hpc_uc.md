## Accessing XSEDE and HPC@UC Computing Resources <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
We’re lucky to have the MERCED Cluster on campus that’s open to faculty and their graduate students, but what do you do if you need more computing power than the 1800+ cores we have on MERCED? There are other resources available to you than you might think. Two resources that are already available to us as part of the University of California: XSEDE and HPC@UC.

### XSEDE
These are national-level computing resources. They are among the fastest supercomputers in the world. And you can access them for FREE!

Here’s an introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBUIBJHZzD4&t=2s) on what XSEDE is.

From [XSEDE Website](https://www.xsede.org/) You can request to use the nearly two dozen resources allocated via XSEDE. Almost all U.S.-based university and non-profit researchers are eligible to request resource allocations, at no cost to you. Allocations are available if you are just getting started in computational science, visualization, or data analysis, if you are an experienced HPC user with large-scale needs or if you are deploying a science gateway. XSEDE also supports allocations for academic courses and training activities. XSEDE provides in depth support for all of these activities through its Extended Collaborative Support Service program.

Please note that XSEDE ends on August 31,2022 and will be transitioning to ACCESS. For more information, please read the XSEDE to ACCESS [website](https://www.xsede.org/advancetoaccess).
