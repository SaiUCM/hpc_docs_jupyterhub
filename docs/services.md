# Other Services Information

## Research Facilitation 

CIRT's goal is to make research efficient, reproducible, and accessible. Our experts are here to provide a range of services to help your research succeed. Our research facilitation service includes providing you with resources and knowledge of IT capabilities and helping you with the technical writing for grants or publishing.

CIRT takes the time to understand your work to ensure the scalability and sustainability of the project. We can help with Version Control, Code testing and optimization, collaboration, software citation, and more.

## High Performance Computing Office Hours  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

CIRT's office hours provide an opportunity for users to bring their laptops, code, and questions, receiving expert assistance on the spot. We encourage experienced graduate students to attend and help their peers in High-Performance Computing (HPC). Faculty and students are welcome to join these sessions. Yue Yu, our Senior Research Computing Facilitator, will be present to meet and assist members of the campus research computing community during these sessions.

Online and In-person information can be found [here](office_hours.md)

## MERCED Cluster Recharge  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED cluster is supported through a recharge model. 

In order to minimize disruptions to computational research on MERCED cluster, the Provost’s office has provided bridge funding for all MERCED cluster PIs for core-hour usage on MERCED through June 30, 2024

What is the unit of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles will be charged by **core-hours<sup>(1)</sup>**.

(1)  A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x (cost per core-hour)
```
!> **For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01, and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.**

(2)  A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)


## Enhanced User Support 
Researchers can request additional support to resolve hardware, application, or maintenance issues on a faculty-managed machine.

Linux/Unix: The CIRT team supports research computing servers with 

- Linux/Unix OS that have not reached End of Life (EOL).  


Windows: The CIRT team supports research computing servers with 

- Windows OS that have not reached End of Life (EOL).

Cost:

The services are billed per hour. The UC rate is $71.14 / hour. The external/Non-UC rate is $108.2 / hour.

## Software Installations  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If the software package or version you need is unavailable in the provided software list, you may compile and install it yourself. The recommended location for user-installed software is the $HOME path. 

If the software installation requires root (sudo) access and/or if you need further assistance installing the software, click [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbde&form_id=0cb3dca04f7d4300b52ba1618110c7ff) to request CIRT support.

## Data Management  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Managing research data can be challenging, especially when the data are large or sensitive (e.g., HIPAA). Through a partnership with the University Library, Research IT can help! We offer services in developing a Data Management Plan through the use of the DMPTool (see [DMPTool.org](DMPTool.org)), and we can assist in specifying application-specific storage solutions for purchase. Request a consultation [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbac&form_id=62be76db4f915300f180022f0310c777). If you require letters of compliance to gain access to sensitive data, or if your research requires you to safeguard sensitive data, we can help you navigate the complex regulatory environment to issue you letters of compliance so you can get started. See [Research Data Management Consultation](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbac&form_id=62be76db4f915300f180022f0310c777) for more information.

## Service Level Agreements  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Research Server Colocation
Researchers can request colocation services for installation, management, and hosting of faculty-owned computational hardware in CIRT-managed data center locations in SE-1, SE-2, SSM, COB-2, and Computational Research Facility (Borg Cube).

This service is for active faculty and research groups (including graduate students) who require colocation services to install, manage and host faculty-owned computational hardware.

[Research General Request/Consultation](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4)

## Active Research Data Storage  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Researchers can request storage for their active primary research data. Designed to be robust, reliable, and easy to access for users on MERCED cluster, this storage is recommended for the following:

• Data storage for active research workflows on MERCED cluster
• Fast read-write data access to and from MERCED cluster compute nodes 
This service is for active faculty and research groups (including graduate students) who require colocation services to install, manage and host faculty-owned computational hardware.

Cost: Active data storage is $0.05/GB/year (startup funds) and $0.06/GB/year (non-startup funds).
