## MERCED cluster <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and
Discovery) Cluster is a 2096 core Linux based high performance computing
cluster supported by the National Science Foundation Award
ACI-1429783. The MERCED cluster runs with the [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) operating system,
and employs the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs. a standard flavor of Linux, and employs the Slurm job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs.


## MERCED recharge service <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
!>__ OIT-CIRT is in an immediate recharge hiatus, retroactive to January 1, 2022.__

The Cyber Infrastructure and Research Technologies (CIRT) team is aware that our recent move to a recharge model has been a pain point for some research groups, and we are working with the Provost’s office to obtain bridge funding to offset CIRT recharge costs for faculty. We will continue to waive all costs for faculty using CIRT recharge services, including costs for using MERCED cluster core-hours, until further notice. 

This is a fluid situation, but we anticipate that costs will be waived through at least April 2022, and possibly beyond. Once details have been finalized, we will reach out again to inform you, and we will also provide all users with at least one month’s notice before recharges begin again. 


__Faculty PIs__: Please ensure that the user accounts are active and provided the COA# [here](https://merced-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yyu49_ucmerced_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyyu49%5Fucmerced%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FMERCED%5Frecharge&ct=1639436999554&or=OWA%2DNT&cid=61ce730a%2D0df2%2Dd438%2D7bdf%2Dbe138cf58c23) before EOB __12/21/2021__.

What is the unit of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles are charged by **core-hours**.

-  A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x (cost per core-hour)
```
!> **For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01, and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.**

-  A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (Fun Fact: The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)


> I don’t want to pay for MERCED what are my options?

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources. Schedule a consultation here.

> I have other questions!

We have put together a FAQ page that has the most common questions received and will be keeping it up to date.

## Facility statement

A team of 17 UC Merced faculty prepared and submitted a Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in early 2014. The NSF awarded this proposal in August 2014 (NSF Award ACI-1429783). Funding from the NSF-MRI grant and associated institutional cost sharing yields a total initial spending budget of $615,842. This MRI proposal requested support for acquisition of a high performance computing (HPC) system to support scientific computing research and training activities at UC Merced and in support of regional interactions with faculty and students at nearby institutions, including the University of the Pacific, California State University Fresno, and California State University Stanislaus. Individual research programs involving computing at UCM are especially diverse, ranging from quantum chemistry to the history of medieval China and from calculation-intensive femtosecond modeling of nanoscale friction to data-intensive statistical analysis of high-volume genomic data. As one might expect, the most advantageous computing environment for one these groups is often different than that for another. Recognizing this reality, and supporting experimentation with as-yet under-utilized hardware configurations for various applications, this funded NSF-MRI proposal supported the acquisition of the MERCED cluster. 

In further support of the involved scientific research pillars, a key role of the MERCED cluster will be to bridge the gap between the modest sized resources that can reasonably be maintained by an individual faculty-led research group and extensive national supercomputer sites such as the XSEDE system (see www.xsede.org). More specifically, we anticipate MERCED offering a number of scientific and training opportunities. These include: 
* the ability to rapidly reconfigure software and hardware as needed for specific projects; 
* the option to run very long-time calculations that cannot be easily adapted to standard queues offered at most supercomputer environments; 
* the ability to generate and analyze very large data sets locally, avoiding long communication delays; 
* the capacity to train students on a full set of computational skills needed to be competitive for jobs as independent researchers. 

We also note that demonstrated software integrity, stability, and scalability are often a required component of allocation requests at major supercomputer sites. The MERCED cluster will provide the necessary resources to carry out such validation studies locally at UC Merced. Finally, the MERCED cluster will provide outstanding support for training and education. As mentioned above, HPC related research plays an important role in the work carried out in the groups at UC Merced. In addition to our Ph.D. and postdoctoral training programs, UC Merced has an active record of undergraduate education and research. Many of the senior personnel of this proposal are also involved with REU and undergraduate research mentoring programs that focus on scientific computing. The MERCED cluster will provide an excellent resource for those programs. We also expect the MERCED cluster to be used by students taking courses related to scientific computing.
