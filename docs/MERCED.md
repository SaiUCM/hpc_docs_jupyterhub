## MERCED cluster <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and
Discovery) Cluster is a 2096 core Linux based high performance computing
cluster. The MERCED cluster runs with the [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) operating system,
and employs the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs. a standard flavor of Linux, and employs the Slurm job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs.


## MERCED recharge service (starting Feb. 2023) <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
!>__OIT-CIRT recharge services, including MERCED cluster core-hours will be renewed starting Feb. 2023.__

In order to minimize disruptions to computational research on MERCED cluster, the Provost’s office has provided bridge funding for all MERCED cluster PIs for core-hour usage on MERCED through June 30, 2024

What is the unit of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles will be charged by **core-hours<sup>(1)</sup>**.

(1)  A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x (cost per core-hour)
```
!> **For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01, and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.**

(2)  A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)
