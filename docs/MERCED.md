## MERCED cluster <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and
Discovery) Cluster is a 2096 core Linux based high performance computing
cluster supported by the National Science Foundation Award
ACI-1429783. The MERCED cluster runs with the [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) operating system,
and employs the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs. a standard flavor of Linux, and employs the Slurm job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs.


## MERCED recharge service <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
!> __MERCED will be a pay-per-use recharge center starting on 1/1/2022.__

With the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, we are
transitioning the MERCED cluster to a recharge service (effective
1/1/2022). Users will receive a monthly baseline allocation of 100
cycles and Faculty PIs will be responsible for covering costs that
exceed this baseline. The costs and policies for recharge were
developed with consultation with the Committee on Research Computing
(CoRC) and approved by the campus Recharge Committee.

Starting on 1/1/2022, each current MERCED cluster user will receive a baseline allocation of 100 core-hours<sup>(1)</sup> per month. If users stay below their baseline hours, no charge will occur. However, faculty PIs responsible for the user accounts will be charged monthly for core-hour usage over the baseline allocation.

__Faculty PIs__: Please ensure that the user accounts listed in your
[account](https://merced-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yyu49_ucmerced_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyyu49%5Fucmerced%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FMERCED%5Frecharge&ct=1639436999554&or=OWA%2DNT&cid=61ce730a%2D0df2%2Dd438%2D7bdf%2Dbe138cf58c23) are accurate
before EOB __12/21/2021__. Email schadalapaka@ucmerced.edu for instructions.

What is the unit and of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles are charged by core-hours.

(1) A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x Cost per core-hour
```
(2) A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (Fun Fact: The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)

For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01 and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources. Schedule a consultation here.

> I have other questions!

We have put together a FAQ page that has the most common questions received and will be keeping it up to date.

Once again, if you have any questions or concerns regarding MERCED

## Facility statement

A team of 17 UC Merced faculty prepared and submitted a Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in early 2014. The NSF awarded this proposal in August 2014 (NSF Award ACI-1429783). Funding from the NSF-MRI grant and associated institutional cost sharing yields a total initial spending budget of $615,842. This MRI proposal requested support for acquisition of a high performance computing (HPC) system to support scientific computing research and training activities at UC Merced and in support of regional interactions with faculty and students at nearby institutions, including the University of the Pacific, California State University Fresno, and California State University Stanislaus. Individual research programs involving computing at UCM are especially diverse, ranging from quantum chemistry to the history of medieval China and from calculation-intensive femtosecond modeling of nanoscale friction to data-intensive statistical analysis of high-volume genomic data. As one might expect, the most advantageous computing environment for one these groups is often different than that for another. Recognizing this reality, and supporting experimentation with as-yet under-utilized hardware configurations for various applications, this funded NSF-MRI proposal supported the acquisition of the MERCED cluster. 

In further support of the involved scientific research pillars, a key role of the MERCED cluster will be to bridge the gap between the modest sized resources that can reasonably be maintained by an individual faculty-led research group and extensive national supercomputer sites such as the XSEDE system (see www.xsede.org). More specifically, we anticipate MERCED offering a number of scientific and training opportunities. These include: 
* the ability to rapidly reconfigure software and hardware as needed for specific projects; 
* the option to run very long-time calculations that cannot be easily adapted to standard queues offered at most supercomputer environments; 
* the ability to generate and analyze very large data sets locally, avoiding long communication delays; 
* the capacity to train students on a full set of computational skills needed to be competitive for jobs as independent researchers. 

We also note that demonstrated software integrity, stability, and scalability are often a required component of allocation requests at major supercomputer sites. The MERCED cluster will provide the necessary resources to carry out such validation studies locally at UC Merced. Finally, the MERCED cluster will provide outstanding support for training and education. As mentioned above, HPC related research plays an important role in the work carried out in the groups at UC Merced. In addition to our Ph.D. and postdoctoral training programs, UC Merced has an active record of undergraduate education and research. Many of the senior personnel of this proposal are also involved with REU and undergraduate research mentoring programs that focus on scientific computing. The MERCED cluster will provide an excellent resource for those programs. We also expect the MERCED cluster to be used by students taking courses related to scientific computing.
