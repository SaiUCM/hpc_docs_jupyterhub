# Technology Integration with Modern Infrastructure

Technology has become an ever important tool in today's classroom and CIRT has been at the forefront of udnerstanding the underlying flexibility, security and reliability in technology that helps all disciplines and majors reach new interactivibilty in the classroom. 

The technology integrated was chosen to reach these goals that are shared all discipines. With ensuring that the course materials are seamlessly accessible to all students, there were two clear requirements that were needed: simple & powerful. The following documentation goes in-depth with Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub for teaching or aiding in instruction. 

## Jupyter Notebooks & JupyterHub

The two softwares that we are introducing are `Jupyter Notebooks` and `JupyterHub`. 

### What is a Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebooks are commonly used throughout academia and in the Data Science field. The advantages of Jupyter Notebooks are that they allow cross and realtime collaboration. The notebooks are interactive as they have the ability for a document, known as a `notebook` to be home to written documentation, code blocks, equations and other forms of multimedia. 

### What is JupyterHub

As the name suggests it is a centrally located hub that houses Jupyter files and information making it easy to collaborate and run computations.
****Why does JupyterHub exist?
Working on JupyterHub provides a number of benefits, especially in an introductory course:

Students never have to do any setup or installation. JupyterHub removes the burden of setting up and maintaining a development environment.

All students and instructors use the same computing environment.

Work stored in the cloud and can be accessed from any computer.

All students have access to the same compute power, regardless of the machine they are using. For example, students without personal computers can use publicly shared computers(i.e. library computers) without being at a disadvantage in the course.

### Local Jupyter versus JupyterHub

| JupyterHub | Local Jupyter Install |
|--------------| --------------------|
| Needs an internet connection | Does not need internet connection |
| Limited resources (disk and RAM) | Resources are only limited by individual computer |
| System-wide installation done by admins| You can install anything you want |
| You can only access files in your account | You can maybe access all files (if you are an admin) |
| If things break, CIRT can assist in helping fix the item | CIRT can not assist in fixing issues on local install |
