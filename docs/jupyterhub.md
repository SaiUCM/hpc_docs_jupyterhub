## Our UC Merced pilot JupyterHub infrastructure is on-line now !
> Please go to the website at  https://ucmerced.2i2c.cloud. 

All active UC Merced students, staff and faculty should have access to the pilot hub.

> What is JupyterHub?

JupyterHub is an open source tool that lets you host a distributed Jupyter Notebook environment. With JupyterHub, users can log in to the server, and write Python code in a web browser, without having to install software on their local machine.

We invite the UC Merced community to use the Hub for teaching (both now and future course planning) and exploring for research.

!> This pilot hub will be online for 11 months and feedback and usage information will be used to plan for our permanent JupyterHub.

> Instructions for Accessing the Pilot JupyterHub:
1. You can login through [UC Merced SSO](https://www.cilogon.org/home)
2. You can use the default jupyterhub image or you can change the image using the [configurator](https://github.com/2i2c-org/2i2c-hubs-image). You can also create your custom user image. There is a guide about this [here](https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/admin/howto/environment/index.html).
3. General information about the user environment [here](https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/admin/howto/environment/index.html).

If you have any additional questions accessing hub, please open a general OIT research computing ticket [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).
