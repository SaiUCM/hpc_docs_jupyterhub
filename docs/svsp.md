# Introduction 
In computing and data processing, there are many ways to produce results. However many times, these options come down to the method being used to run the computations; these options are `serial` and `parallel` job design. The choice between serial and parallel job design and implementation is critical to the speed and effeciancy of the job. This page covers the advantages, trade-offs and use caeses of serial and parallel jobs. 

## Serial Job

### Definition <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

A serial job is a job in which the instructions or operations are executed one after the other in a sequential manner or linear manner. Each step is completed before the next one begins. 

#### Advantages <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. Simplicity

    Serial jobs are easy to understand and implement, as they follow a straightforward and predetermined path. 

2. Executes Linearly

    Because tasks are executed in a fixed order, you can predict the exact outcome of the job, making debugging and error handling more straightforward.

3. Resouce Efficiancy 

   Serial jobs typically require less resources, making them suitable for simple tasks or simple calculations. 

Serial jobs are best used when calcuating simple or linear calculations, teaching and experimenting with SLURM job submissions


### Serial Job Use Cases <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. Simple and basic data processing and calculations. 

    Serial Jobs are great when there is not a lot of data that is being inputted and being used to deliver the end result. As the more data that needs to be processed the longer the overall computation time will be. 
2. Introduction and education of High Performance Computing 

    Serial jobs are great for learning how to use HPC resources as they are much simpler and easier to follow along in their process and computations than parallel jobs. 
3. 


## Parallel Job 

### Definition <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Parallel jobs involve breaking down a task into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously by multiple processors. Through dividing up the bigger task into smaller sub-tasks this also allows communication between these independent sub-tasks for bette communication and data sharing. 

### Advantages <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
1. Parallel jobs make efficient use of available hardware resources, enabling high throughput and resource optimization.
    
    The first big advanage to parallel jobs is resource effiency it introduces, as one big task is being divided up and conquered by smaller, yet indepently running sub-tasks.

2. Scalability
    Parallization of a job are able to be scaled much greatly than serial jobs, allowing more quicker and effiecent computation and data processing in bigger quanitities. 



### Use Cases <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
1. Big Data Processing

    Parallel jobs allow for a much better utilization of allocated resources as they are able to divide up the inputted data and process the data concurrently

2. Scientific Simulations
    Parallel jobs allow for a much more effecient process and output of simulations and models

## Parallel vs Serial Jobs

When deciding whether to use serial or parallel jobs, consider the following factors:

1. Task Complexity

2. Data Quanity 

3. Resource Limitations

4. Familiarity with best Serial and Parallel job practices 

5. Expected Data input and/or output.
